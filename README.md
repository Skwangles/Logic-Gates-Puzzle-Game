# Logic-Gates-Puzzle-Game
This was a game created for school.
The aim of the game is to light up the bulb at the end. 
I've assorted the levels based on difficulty with which Logic gates are used.

The levels are randomized, 
a system randomly enables and disables buttons until the newly created level has the light bulb turned off and then shows the level to the user.
